# BC-SDN-Against-Black-Hole-Attack
A Simulation of The System I propose for BC-SDN routing Against the Black Hole Attack

From the abstract of my write-up: "This paper studies the black hole attack in block-chain software defined networks (BC-SDNs). BC-SDNs are similar to normal SDNs except that their control layers are block-chain networks. This is a relatively new creation that has not had much analysis on its interaction with various attacks. I used the general system structure described in Karakus et. al. and the routing algorithms created by Guillen et. al. and Elmahdi et. al. to propose a system with routing that can withstand a black hole attack. The method involves elements of finding disjoint paths, homomorphic encryption, and multipath routing to create a novel system. The results showed an improvement in the accuracy of delivering the entire message at the cost of the packet delivery ratio, representing a trade-off with network bandwidth."

The main file is the actual simulation I conducted and the sender/reciever file is the example of how to implement Gorti's EHC as I mentioned in the write-up.
